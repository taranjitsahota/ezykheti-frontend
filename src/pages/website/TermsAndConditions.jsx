          Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, these Terms shall be
          exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
          India. Any dispute, conflict, claim or controversy arising out of or

          enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to
          mediation proceedings in terms of the Indian law. If such Dispute has
          not been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation
          has been submitted under the Indian laws, such Dispute can be referred
          to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under
          the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). The Dispute shall
          be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with

          arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native
          language. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration
          proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties,

          <strong>CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Claims of copyright infringement should be sent to EzyKheti’s
          designated agent. Please visit EzyKheti’s web page at
          https://www.EzyKheti.com for the designated address and additional
          information. NOTICE. EzyKheti may give notice by means of a general
          notice on the Services, electronic mail to your email address in your
          Account, or by written communication sent to your address as set forth
          in your Account. You may give notice to EzyKheti by written
          communication to EzyKheti's address as mentioned above GENERAL. You
          may not assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part without
          EzyKheti’s prior written approval. You give your approval to EzyKheti
          for it to assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part,
          including to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of
          EzyKheti’s equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger.
          No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
          exists between you, EzyKheti or any Third Party Provider as a result
          of the contract between you and EzyKheti or use of the Services. If
          any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or
          unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or
          part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of these
          Terms but the legality, validity and enforceability of the other
          provisions in these Terms shall not be affected. In that event, the
          parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision
          or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid
          and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a
          similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or
          part thereof, given the contents and purpose of these Terms. These
          Terms constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties
          with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all
          prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such
          subject matter. In these Terms, the words “including” and “include”
          mean “including, but not limited to.”

          <strong>EZYKHETI GUIDELINES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES</strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          The following guidelines are intended to inform law enforcement about
          the legal process for seeking records from EzyKheti. These are merely
          guidelines, and this information may change at any time. For private
          party requests, including requests from civil litigants and criminal
          defendants, we recommend browsing Guidelines for Third Party Data
          Requests.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <strong>WHAT IS EZYKHETI AND WHAT RECORDS DO WE HAVE?</strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          EzyKheti is a technology company that has developed an app that
          connects users (riders) with driver partners who provide agriculture
          services to the user. Users can use the EzyKheti App to request
          agriculture equipemnts services via their smartphone, the web, or via
          SMS. At the end of the service provider both the driver/ partner and
          user receive a copy of the service used receipt. More information
          about our services is available here. We store and maintain
          information as described in our Privacy Statements and our Terms of
          Use.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <strong>
            WHAT TYPE OF LEGAL PROCESS DOES EZYKHETI REQUIRE BEFORE PRODUCING
            USER OR PARTNER INFORMATION?
          </strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          For Indian Law Enforcement We require valid and sufficient legal
          process before we can disclose business records regarding partners,
          users, or trips. In most instances, we won’t be able to provide any
          information without a valid subpoena, court order, or search warrant.
          We accept law enforcement requests via email to admin@EzyKheti.com Our
          acceptance of legal process does not waive any legal objections
          EzyKheti may have and may raise in response to the request.
        </p>

          <strong>
            WHAT FORM OF REQUESTS DOES EZYKHETI REQUIRE, AND HOW ARE REQUESTS
            PROCESSED?
          </strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          To respond to a request, we will need to receive the applicable
          process described above, as well as a valid return email address from
          an official government domain. We review each request for facial and
          substantive validity, and will reject requests that are not facially
          and substantively valid. Among other things, we require requests to be
          narrowly tailored to a legitimate law enforcement need and will reject
          overly broad, vague, or unduly burdensome requests. In order to make
          sure your Law Enforcement Request is valid and does not seek more
          information than necessary, we ask for the following: A sufficiently
          narrow/defined time period; A specific event or action that the
          subject took; A specific reference (i.e., you must uniquely identify a
          user or driver partner) We disclose data to law enforcement when we
          determine that we are required to do so by law. In those instances, we
          will search for and disclose data that we are reasonably able to
          locate and retrieve.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <strong>HOW DOES EZYKHETI HANDLE EMERGENCY REQUESTS?</strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency basis where
          there is an emergency that involves protecting a user, driver partner,
          or third party or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate
          threat of death or serious bodily harm. Requestors must submit an
          Emergency Request Form (which can be requested through
          admin@EzyKheti.com) that describes in detail the nature of the
          emergency, and we review these requests on a case-by- case basis. Law
          enforcement can submit an emergency request by emailing
          admin@EzyKheti.com. Please note that we will only review and respond
          to emergency requests from law enforcement, and will not respond to
          emergency requests sent to this address by non-law enforcement
          officials. Non-law enforcement officials aware of an emergency
          situation should immediately and directly contact local law
          enforcement officials.
        </p>

          <strong>
            DOES EZYKHETI NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST FOR
            INFORMATION RELATING TO THEM?
          </strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          Yes, we may notify subjects before producing their information to law
          enforcement, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so, or in
          exceptional circumstances such as emergencies. Law enforcement
          officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an
          investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other
          appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.
